The plugin was developed during the final project of the Computer Science department at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. TrackOptimizer is designed to detect and correct anomalies in trajectories, based on an easy-to-use base trajectory line that can be created by the user or obtained via the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This makes it a comprehensive tool for trajectory data validation and correction.
